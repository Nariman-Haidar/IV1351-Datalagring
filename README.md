Realization of Point-of-Sale (POS) System for Retail Store
This project aims to develops a domain model and system sequence diagram for a retail store's Point-of-Sale system.

Designed and implemented the core domain model to represent key entities in a retail store, ensuring clarity in how different parts of the system interacted.

Developed system sequence diagrams (SSD) for both the basic flow and alternative flows to handle real-world sales transactions, such as processing multiple items, applying discounts, and managing failed item lookups.

Worked with object-oriented principles and design patterns to ensure high cohesion and low coupling across different layers of the system.

Implemented core logic for handling sales, calculating totals with VAT, and managing discount applications.

Used object-oriented principles to structure the program into clearly defined classes and layers.

Ensured that the program adhered to the MVC and Layered design patterns.

Encapsulated data in the model layer and ensured communication through controller methods.

IT Tools: Git (version control), UML diagrams for design
Programming Languages: Java
